# RPG

This is going to replace the Clojure RPG game I was working on.

I really like Clojure, but it is too frustrating working with the Java swing API for 2d graphics (Seriously, I find legacy OpenGL just as coherent).

I would much rather just do everything in the browser. I could try Clojure Script to write Clojure code that compiles to JS.
But with the new ES6 standard, I think vanilla JS is much simpler, as well as being a nice all around functional alternative.

Going to make casual updates to this whenever I have time.
